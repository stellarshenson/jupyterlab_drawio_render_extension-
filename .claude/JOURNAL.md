# Claude Code Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

1. **Task - Project initialization** (v0.1.0): Initial setup of jupyterlab_drawio_render_extension as a new JupyterLab 4 extension project<br>
   **Result**: Project created from JupyterLab extension template using copier. Structure includes TypeScript frontend (`src/index.ts`, `src/request.ts`), Python server extension (`jupyterlab_drawio_render_extension/`), GitHub Actions workflows for build/release, UI tests with Playwright/Galata, and Makefile for build automation. The extension provides Draw.io diagram rendering capability within JupyterLab - a read-only viewer widget. Configuration files created: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` importing workspace-level rules with project-specific context for npm package `jupyterlab_drawio_render_extension` and PyPI package `jupyterlab-drawio-render-extension`. README.md updated with standard badges (GitHub Actions, npm, PyPI, downloads, JupyterLab 4, KOLOMOLO, PayPal) and feature list following the terminal extension pattern.

2. **Task - Draw.io viewer implementation** (v0.1.1): Implemented client-side Draw.io diagram rendering for JupyterLab<br>
   **Result**: Created complete viewer implementation following the ABCWidgetFactory pattern from `jupyterlab_doc_reader_extension`. Added dependencies `@jupyterlab/docregistry`, `@lumino/coreutils`, `@lumino/widgets` to `package.json`. Created `src/widget.ts` with `DrawioWidget` class that parses Draw.io XML (both compressed and uncompressed formats), converts mxGraphModel to SVG using DOM APIs, handles multi-page diagrams with navigation toolbar, and displays errors gracefully. The decompression uses browser's native `DecompressionStream` API for deflate-raw. Rewrote `src/index.ts` to register `.drawio` and `.dio` file types with docRegistry and create `DrawioFactory` widget factory with text model and readOnly flag. Added comprehensive CSS styles in `style/base.css` using JupyterLab theme variables for container, toolbar, SVG display, loading state, and error presentation. SVG rendering supports shapes (rectangle, ellipse, rhombus, hexagon, triangle, cylinder), edges with waypoints and arrow markers, text labels with multi-line support, and style parsing for fill/stroke colors, dashed lines, and rounded corners. Build verified with `make install` - extension enabled and operational at v0.1.1.

3. **Task - Switch to embedded viewer** (v0.1.3): Replaced custom SVG renderer with official Draw.io viewer library and fixed file icon override<br>
   **Result**: Custom SVG rendering caused text misalignment and missing images. Rewrote `src/widget.ts` to use official Draw.io embedded viewer library (`viewer-static.min.js` from `https://viewer.diagrams.net/js/`). Implementation dynamically loads the script once, creates a div with class `mxgraph` and `data-mxgraph` JSON configuration containing diagram XML, then calls `GraphViewer.processElements()` to render. Configuration enables zoom toolbar, layers panel, lightbox view, and navigation. Fixed file icon override issue in `src/index.ts` by checking if file type already exists before registering (avoids conflict with jupyterlab-drawio editor extension) and setting `defaultFor: []` so the viewer appears as "Open With" option rather than replacing default handler. Simplified `style/base.css` removing custom toolbar and SVG styling since GraphViewer handles rendering. Build successful at v0.1.3.

4. **Task - Local mxgraph rendering** (v0.1.8): Switched to bundled mxgraph library for offline rendering due to CSP restrictions<br>
   **Result**: External Draw.io viewer script and iframe approaches both blocked by JupyterLab's Content Security Policy. Rewrote `src/widget.ts` to use npm `mxgraph@^4.2.2` package for local offline rendering. Implementation initializes mxgraph factory, creates `mxGraph` instance in container, uses `mxCodec` to decode Draw.io XML format (handles both compressed base64+deflate and uncompressed XML). Added custom toolbar with zoom in/out/fit/actual size buttons using `_graph.zoomIn()`, `_graph.zoomOut()`, `_graph.fit()`, `_graph.zoomActual()` methods. Mouse wheel zoom enabled via `mxEvent.addMouseWheelListener()`. Graph configured read-only with `setEnabled(false)`, panning enabled. Created `src/mxgraph.d.ts` TypeScript declaration file for untyped mxgraph module exporting `mxGraph`, `mxCodec`, `mxUtils`, `mxEvent`, `mxClient`. Updated `src/index.ts` to search for existing file types (including `vscode-drawio` from jupyterlab_vscode_icons_extension) before registering to preserve third-party icons, set `defaultFor: [fileTypeName]` to make viewer the default handler. Updated `style/base.css` with toolbar styling (`.jp-DrawioWidget-toolbar`, `.jp-DrawioWidget-toolbarBtn`) and graph container (`.jp-DrawioWidget-graph` with white background). Build successful at v0.1.8.

5. **Task - Debug mxgraph rendering** (v0.1.18): Investigated blank diagram rendering issue with npm mxgraph package<br>
   **Result**: Diagram viewer showing blank despite successful XML parsing. Added extensive console logging to trace execution flow. Debug output revealed mxCodec.decode() was returning DOM elements instead of properly instantiated mxCell objects - the npm mxgraph package's codec doesn't work the same as traditional mxGraph. Discovered model.cells dictionary was being populated (28 cells) but parent-child relationships weren't being established - getChildCount() returned 0 for all nodes. Added pako library for proper deflate decompression of compressed Draw.io content. Disabled mxLoadResources and mxLoadStylesheets to prevent CSP errors from external resource loading. Tried multiple approaches: (1) codec.decode with beginUpdate/endUpdate wrapper, (2) manual cell parsing with mxCell/mxGeometry constructors - rendered but looked incorrect, (3) decode mxGraphModel and extract populated root to set on model. Current implementation at v0.1.18 uses approach #3. Investigation ongoing - npm mxgraph package may have fundamental compatibility issues with Draw.io XML format.
